## README for Experiment Report on Microbial Growth, Bioflocculant Production, and Substrate Consumption

## Overview
This project analyzes microbial growth, bioflocculant production, and substrate consumption using Python for data processing and visualization. The analysis incorporates key models such as:

- **Logistic Growth Model** for microbial growth.
- **Luedeking-Piret Model** for bioflocculant production.
- **Monod Model** for substrate consumption.

The dataset was processed using a calibration curve to convert absorbance values into concentration values. Various kinetic models were fitted to the data to extract insights on growth, production, and consumption rates.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Converts absorbance readings into meaningful concentration values using a calibration curve.
- **Growth Analysis**: Fits a **logistic growth model** to microbial cell growth data.
- **Bioflocculant Production Analysis**: Uses the **Luedeking-Piret model** to assess production kinetics.
- **Substrate Consumption Analysis**: Applies the **Monod model** to determine substrate consumption dynamics.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs to depict microbial growth, bioflocculant production, and substrate utilization trends.

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Ensure the experimental dataset includes time, absorbance values, and other relevant measurements.
   - Use a calibration curve to convert absorbance values into concentration values.

2. **Run the Python Analysis**:
   - Execute the script to fit the models and generate visualizations.
   - The output will include growth rates, production rates, and substrate consumption patterns.

3. **Interpret Results**:
   - Analyze the graphs and model outputs to draw conclusions about microbial kinetics.
   - Use insights to optimize fermentation processes for bioflocculant production.
